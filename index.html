                At MNX.AI, I was an
                <b>AI Engineer Intern</b>. For this position, I:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Implemented a logging system using the SQLAlchemy Python
                  Library to record every prompt generated by Google models
                  utilized along with key statistics such as the duration of the
                  runs in Cloud SQL for MySQL.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Automated the process of generating styled Excel spreadsheets
                  for model outputs using Python.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Generated a new report type through prompt engineering which
                  enabled the summarization of documents.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Engineered prompts leading to a 5% improvement in the
                  performance of question answering prompts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Created a filter to eliminate irrelevant documents from
                  consideration for prompt answering.
                </li>
              </ul>

                I am a fourth-year undergraduate student (senior status,
                graduating December 2024) studying Computer Science at the
                Wertheim College of Engineering at the University of Florida
                with a current GPA of 3.95. In addition to my Major Coursework,
                I am also enrolled in the Combination Degree Program at the
                University of Florida, meaning that I am simultaneously
                completing my Bachelor's Degree while starting my Master's
                Degree. I both am doing this and taking additional courses in
                Artificial Intelligence in hopes of specializing in the field as
                I see how pertinent this field of Computer Science is both now
                and how huge it will be in the future. <br /><br />
