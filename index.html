              <p>
                I am a master's student (graduating December 2025) studying 
                Computer Science at the Wertheim College of Engineering at the 
                University of Florida with a current GPA of 3.90. As an undergraduate 
                student, I was also enrolled in the Combination Degree Program at the 
                University of Florida, which allowed me to simultaneously complete my 
                Bachelor's Degree, which I completed graduating Summa Cum Laude with a 
                3.95/4.00 GPA, while starting my Master's Degree. Thanks to this, I have 
                been able to take many Artificial Intelligence courses in addition to my 
                core required classes as well as courses in the realm
                of Human Centered Computing; this semester, I will be taking additional
                courses in Bioinformatics and Virtual Reality to further branch out 
                into new areas in Computer Science. <br /><br />
                Here is a list of relevant courses that I have taken (or am currently
                completing) outside of my core undergraduate coursework at the University of Florida:
