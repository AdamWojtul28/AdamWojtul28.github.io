                      I am a fourth-year undergraduate student (senior status, graduating
                      December 2024) studying Computer Science at the Wertheim College of
                      Engineering at the University of Florida with a current GPA of 3.95.
                      In addition to my Major Coursework, I am also enrolled in the
                      Combination Degree Program at the University of Florida, meaning that
                      I am simultaneously completing my Bachelor's Degree while starting my
                      Master's Degree. I both am doing this and taking additional courses in
                      Artificial Intelligence in hopes of specializing in the field as I see
                      how pertinent this field of Computer Science is both now and how huge
                      it will be in the future. <br /><br />
