                BitTorrent Clone - Computer Network Fundamentals Semester
                Project
              </h2>
              <p>
                In my Computer Network Fundamentals class at the University of
                Florida, we were told by our professor to divide ourselves into
                groups of 4 to develop a BitTorrent clone using Java that allows
                peers to connect over a peer-to-peer network architecture. As
                part of this group, I worked in an AGILE environment, meeting
                weekly with my group to report progress and create new tasks. As
                part of this group, I developed the preliminary (later updated)
                architecture to connect peers with one another using TCP
                connections and created the handshaking response function,
                implemented functionality that would allow a peer to obtain file
                pieces of interest from preferred neighbors and to send relevant
                pieces to its preferred neighbors, and I finalized the packaging
                for the project, ensuring that it would work on non-local
                computers.

                Worldlier (Social Media) Application - Introduction to Software
                Engineering Semester Project
              </h2>
              <p>
                In my Introduction to Software Engineering class, the class was
                tasked to divide itself into groups of about 4 students to work
                on a semester-long project in an AGILE like environment. Since
                the scope of the project was open, I wanted to create an app
                that would solve problems for people who frequently travel to
                foreign countries and who would like to meet people there to
                build connections with locals. In my group, I worked with
                Darrion Ramos to develop the backend for a social media web
                application using Golang and SQL and design a RESTful backend
                server that stores and maintains users in a MySQL online
                database. Some of the features that I was responsible for in the
                app was maintaining users in the database, providing matchmaking
                functionality, which paired users with similar interests,
                logging users into the database, and providing basic chat
                functionality, allowing users to communicate with each other. On
                top of this, over the course of the process, to determine how
                feasible it was to make a startup out of a company like this, I
                interviewed over 70 college students (in my own time, as this
                was not required) to obtain feedback and adjust the project's
                features; I even developed high and low fidelity prototypes of
                the website interface to show to users. Based on the feedback
                that I received, I advised my teammates regarding what
                functionality the app needed and provided input into the design
                of the interface of the application. After the end of the
                semester, my group disbanded, but I plan to continue this
                project once I find a new group of individuals who would like to
                help me pursue this dream project.

                Product Related Injuries App - Information and Database Systems
                1 Semester Project
              </h2>
              <p>
                In my Information and Database Systems 1 class, the class was
                tasked to divide itself into groups of about 4 students to work
                on a semester-long project. Since the scope of the project was
                open, so long as the dataset we used had over 200,000 datapoints
                and our project incorporated at least 6 complex SQL queries, our
                group decided to make an information app to alert people about
                products that are responsible for a lot of injuries for
                individuals; the app would also show what age groups are most
                affected by certain products. In my group, I developed the
                backend for the web application using Golang and SQL and
                designed a RESTful backend server that provides information
                about the products in an Oracle database when called by the
                frontend. I was also responsible for the development of all of
                the complex queries; some of these queries included finding what
                products were in the top 10 deadliest product every month over
                the course of the dataset timeframe, finding which products were
                most dangerous in the summer months, and which products had the
                longest consecutive days resulting in an individual's injuries.
                During the day of the presentation, I demoed the functionality
                of the backend and explained all of the queries to my professor.

              <h2>Student Organization Hub UX Design Project</h2>
              <p>
                Our semester project in UX Design was to research what kinds of
                students were having on our campus and subsequently design the
                interface for an application that would solve one of the major
                problems that was mentioned. After completing initial
                interviews, our group determined that many students mentioned
                that it was quite difficult to easily find information about
                student organizations that would suit them. We also interviewed
                several officers from student organizations on our campus and we
                learned that many student organizations have to rely on using
                several apps to accommodate all of their needs. So, we designed
                an app that served two purposes: 1) to be a hub for all student
                organizations to promote their club, with features that would
                allow students to more easily find their club and 2) once those
                users join, to serve as the platform that would contain
                everything the club needed to operate, with features like group
                chats, announcements, and a calendar. Our group went through a
                significant portion of the UX Design process, from gathering
                information about the problems to developing a high fidelity
                prototype of the application; interviews were completed after
                every step of the process to receive feedback from potential
                users. After our group had a clear understanding of the
                students' needs, a low fidelity prototype was made with paper
                models before subsequently transitioning to the final project, a
                high-fidelity prototype which was made using Figma.
