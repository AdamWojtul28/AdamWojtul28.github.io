              <h2>Metal Releases Notification Bot</h2>
              <p>
                Since I am a huge fan of metal music and I constantly am
                interested in finding new bands from my favorite subgenres, I
                decided to make several scripts that webscrape information from
                metal release calendars and lastfm.com to send me updates via a
                Telegram bot whenever a new album from one of my favorite metal
                subgenres is added to a metal release calendar. Currently, the
                webscraping functionality is complete and I am able to send
                myself updates via the Telegram bot manually using the Telegram
                API, but I now need to figure out how to schedule this process
                for a) new album release announcements (whenever an album is
                added to a calendar) and b) on release day, so I am aware of all
                albums that were released on a release day.

              <h2>Teacher Assistant Application Redesign</h2>
              <p>
                As part of my Human Computer Interaction course at the
                University of Florida (CAP5100), students were tasked to team up
                and improve upon an existing interface using the methodologies
                we had learned in our course. Since Sean, my teammate is a TA
                who had frustrations about the current Teacher Assistant
                Application System (TAAS), we decided to redesign the system. We
                started by conducting research and seeing what problems other
                users had with the existing system and we brainstormed ways to
                improve the system. I then made a paper prototype of the system
                (a total of around 20 screens) that Sean made a Figma based off
                of. After this process was completed, Sean and I got to work on
                the application itself. Sean worked on the login, student, and
                professor sides of the application while I worked exclusively on
                the System-Administrator side of the app, since it had the most
                functionality. As part of the system-admin side, I worked on
                creating a dashboard that showed action items in the form of
                both courses and students that needed assignment and the
                respective home pages for each of those to see the remainder of
                the items. I also worked on all reports and documentation
                related to the project, contributing to the Related Works, User
                Requirements, Interface Design, and Discussion and recording the
                video demo of our project.

              <h2>Senior Project - TablerEnabler Application</h2>
              <p>
                As part of my Senior Project course at the University of Florida
                (CIS4914), students were tasked to create groups and come up
                with projects that showcased what they had learned during their
                time at the University of Florida. Since a lot of my non-core
                coursework related to creating user-friendly designs, our group
                decided to research about a problem that existed on our campus
                that we could then go out and solve. We noticed the problem that
                lots of student organizations table without much success on
                campus and therefore we wanted to create an application that did
                a better job at connecting students to student organizations who
                are tabling, which we called TablerEnabler. We started off by
                conducting end-user research, where we interviewed students and
                student organizations about our application, trying to
                understand their problems. We then created paper prototypes and
                a Figma prototype to get feedback on the interface that we had
                in mind to address this problem. Upon receiving positive
                feedback, our group took to developing; in this group I had the
                role of developing the backend using MongoDB. I first developed
                an Entity-Relationship Diagram and a Relational Schema for how
                tables relate to one another. I made all of these tables in
                MongoDB and I am now in the process of developing RESTful API
                endpoints to allow the frontend to extract relevant information
                from the database. Once I set up the database tables, my focus
                turned to helping my teammates develop the frontend side of the
                application. I was responsible for fully developing the
                organization profile, favorites, (future) map-view and
                system-administrator practically in their totality and I helped
                touch up the search page and the buttons on each page so that
                they navigated to the corresponding page of interest. I was
                heavily involved in this project and along with Mikhail, I was
                one of the two project managers for this project. I am proud of
                how it turned out.

              <h2>JVM Compiler</h2>
              <p>
                During my Programming Language Principles class, I was tasked
                with developing a compiler for a small language on the JVM with
                Java, including tokenization, syntax parsing, semantic analysis,
                and bytecode generation with a classmate. For the project, my
                teammate and I took turns developing the code and developing
                test cases using JUnit Tests.

                BitTorrent Clone - Computer Network Fundamentals Semester
                Project
              </h2>
              <p>
                In my Computer Network Fundamentals class at the University of
                Florida, we were told by our professor to divide ourselves into
                groups of 4 to develop a BitTorrent clone using Java that allows
                peers to connect over a peer-to-peer network architecture. As
                part of this group, I worked in an AGILE environment, meeting
                weekly with my group to report progress and create new tasks. As
                part of this group, I developed the preliminary (later updated)
                architecture to connect peers with one another using TCP
                connections and created the handshaking response function,
                implemented functionality that would allow a peer to obtain file
                pieces of interest from preferred neighbors and to send relevant
                pieces to its preferred neighbors, and I finalized the packaging
                for the project, ensuring that it would work on non-local
                computers.

                Worldlier (Social Media) Application - Introduction to Software
                Engineering Semester Project
              </h2>
              <p>
                In my Introduction to Software Engineering class, the class was
                tasked to divide itself into groups of about 4 students to work
                on a semester-long project in an AGILE like environment. Since
                the scope of the project was open, I wanted to create an app
                that would solve problems for people who frequently travel to
                foreign countries and who would like to meet people there to
                build connections with locals. In my group, I worked with
                Darrion Ramos to develop the backend for a social media web
                application using Golang and SQL and design a RESTful backend
                server that stores and maintains users in a MySQL online
                database. Some of the features that I was responsible for in the
                app was maintaining users in the database, providing matchmaking
                functionality, which paired users with similar interests,
                logging users into the database, and providing basic chat
                functionality, allowing users to communicate with each other. On
                top of this, over the course of the process, to determine how
                feasible it was to make a startup out of a company like this, I
                interviewed over 70 college students (in my own time, as this
                was not required) to obtain feedback and adjust the project's
                features; I even developed high and low fidelity prototypes of
                the website interface to show to users. Based on the feedback
                that I received, I advised my teammates regarding what
                functionality the app needed and provided input into the design
                of the interface of the application. After the end of the
                semester, my group disbanded, but I plan to continue this
                project once I find a new group of individuals who would like to
                help me pursue this dream project.

                Product Related Injuries App - Information and Database Systems
                1 Semester Project
              </h2>
              <p>
                In my Information and Database Systems 1 class, the class was
                tasked to divide itself into groups of about 4 students to work
                on a semester-long project. Since the scope of the project was
                open, so long as the dataset we used had over 200,000 datapoints
                and our project incorporated at least 6 complex SQL queries, our
                group decided to make an information app to alert people about
                products that are responsible for a lot of injuries for
                individuals; the app would also show what age groups are most
                affected by certain products. In my group, I developed the
                backend for the web application using Golang and SQL and
                designed a RESTful backend server that provides information
                about the products in an Oracle database when called by the
                frontend. I was also responsible for the development of all of
                the complex queries; some of these queries included finding what
                products were in the top 10 deadliest product every month over
                the course of the dataset timeframe, finding which products were
                most dangerous in the summer months, and which products had the
                longest consecutive days resulting in an individual's injuries.
                During the day of the presentation, I demoed the functionality
                of the backend and explained all of the queries to my professor.

              <h2>Student Organization Hub UX Design Project</h2>
              <p>
                Our semester project in UX Design was to research what kinds of
                students were having on our campus and subsequently design the
                interface for an application that would solve one of the major
                problems that was mentioned. After completing initial
                interviews, our group determined that many students mentioned
                that it was quite difficult to easily find information about
                student organizations that would suit them. We also interviewed
                several officers from student organizations on our campus and we
                learned that many student organizations have to rely on using
                several apps to accommodate all of their needs. So, we designed
                an app that served two purposes: 1) to be a hub for all student
                organizations to promote their club, with features that would
                allow students to more easily find their club and 2) once those
                users join, to serve as the platform that would contain
                everything the club needed to operate, with features like group
                chats, announcements, and a calendar. Our group went through a
                significant portion of the UX Design process, from gathering
                information about the problems to developing a high fidelity
                prototype of the application; interviews were completed after
                every step of the process to receive feedback from potential
                users. After our group had a clear understanding of the
                students' needs, a low fidelity prototype was made with paper
                models before subsequently transitioning to the final project, a
                high-fidelity prototype which was made using Figma.
